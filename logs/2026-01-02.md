# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What *clicked* today?
  - Deno configuration
  - Shell Scripting(conditions, loops)
  - User snippet
- What changed in your understanding?
  - We can change valid data(which is possible to convert) into json format using JSON.stringify and we can pass the space count.
  - We can parse a json data using JSON.parse.
  - We can write conditions with [[ ]] and loops(for, while). We can make our own snippets.
- What would you explain differently now?
  - We can pass the space count into JSON.stringify

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
  - Uses of replacer in JSON.stringify
  - Uses of reviver in JSON.parse
  - Working of acceleration(code) in the given example.
- What would you like to see one more example of?
  - Uses of replacer and reviver.
- What feels fragile in your understanding?
  - Adding acceleration and velocity is confusing. I don't understand how it was working.

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:
- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- what is the use of replacer and reviver? How can i use them?
- what changes are happening on position when we add acceleration and velocity.

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- A REPL experiment
- A minimal snippet
- A variation of today’s code

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because we learn so many things like conditions and loops in shell and p5.js etc.

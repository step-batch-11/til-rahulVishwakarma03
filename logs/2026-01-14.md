# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What *clicked* today?
  - sqlite(creating database, .exec(),.prepare(), .run(), .all(), )
  - dependencies
- What changed in your understanding?
- What would you explain differently now?
  - Adding dependencies in deno task is necessary if you want to execute any other task just before the given task
  - .exac() is used to execute the given query(arg) but we can not inject any value in that query. It will be only a string.
  - prepare() is used as both .exac() and to create a template for any query like select, update, delete. In this fn we can inject any value using run().
